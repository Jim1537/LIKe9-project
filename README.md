# LIKe9-project
Some basic/universal libraries created for my "LIKe9" project (http://like9.jimblog.me/)

- **LK9analog**. To get readings from simple analog sensors by internal timer. Photoresistors, MQ-series sensors, etc.
- **LK9thermo**. To get actual temperature from thermistor by internal timer (Kelvin, Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- **LK9touch**. To get readings from capacitive touch sensor. Has internal counter of sequential touches.
